An app to greenify travel made for Qhacks.

***

**From Here to There** is an android application which gives user recommendations on mode of transport based on user preferences of time and environmental friendliness. The app displays CO2 emissions and money saved for using an alternative green mode of transportation, as well as show an approximate amount of calories burned per kilometer travelled. This is meant to persuade the user to take environmentally friendly travel methods, when time and distance permit.

## Problem we hope to solve:  
We hope to lesson the use of vehicular transportation which produces greenhouse gasses, and in turn promote an active lifestyle. 
	
## How we are different:  
We provide positive incentive to be environmentally friendly by listing the amount of CO2 saved, money saved, and calories burned. This is all while being a practical, simple method of giving the user choice over how environmentally friendly they want to be.
